# Battleship Game

## Overview
This project is a MATLAB-based implementation of the classic game Battleship, developed as part of the ENGR 1182 class at The Ohio State University. Our version allows two players to place their ships on a grid and attempt to sink each other's ships by guessing their locations.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction
- Two-player gameplay on the same computer
- Custom ship placement with visual feedback
- Hit and miss system with visual updates on the game board
- Option to play again after a game concludes

## Prerequisites
Before running this game, ensure you have:
- MATLAB 
- Simple Game Engine 

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the game files to your computer.
2. Ensure the `simpleGameEngine` is in the same directory as the game files or is properly referenced.
3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the game files.

## How to Play
1. Run the `battleship.m` script in MATLAB to start the game.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to place your ships on the grid. Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically.
3. Once both players have placed their ships, Player 1 will be prompted to make the first move.
4. Players take turns guessing the location of the other's ships by clicking on the grid.
5. The game provides visual feedback for hits and misses, aiming to sink all the opponent's ships.
6. The game ends when all ships of one player are sunk, declaring the winner.
7. Players will be given the option to play again after the game concludes.

## Gameplay Rules
- Each player places 3 ships, each occupying 4 consecutive squares on their side of the board.
- Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically but cannot overlap.
- Players take turns guessing the location of the opponent's ships.
- The game ends when one player has sunk all the opponent's ships.
